Test inputs
===========

Each subdirectory is a bag. If it is an non-compliant bag, the name of the
bag should contain an indication of what rule the bag violates. In general, only
one rule should be violated per bag.

Naming conventions
------------------
**Developers, please mind these conventions**:

* Use only lowercase characters in the bag directory names, separated by dashes.
* Start with the general area in which the rule to be tested is located, such as `ddm`, `bagit`, etc. For truely generic
  data use the prefix `generic`.
